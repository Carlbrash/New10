# Team System API Testing Results

## Summary

I've completed testing of the Team System backend endpoints. Most endpoints are working correctly, including team creation, team listing, team details, inviting players, and accepting invitations. However, there is an issue with the GET /api/teams/my-invitations endpoint, which returns a 404 'Team not found' error when trying to retrieve invitations for the admin user. Despite this issue, the invitation acceptance flow works if you have the invitation ID directly.

## Test Results

### 1. GET /api/teams (list all teams)
- **Status**: ✅ Working
- **Details**: Initially returned an empty list of teams, and after team creation, it correctly returned the newly created team with all expected fields.

### 2. POST /api/teams (create team)
- **Status**: ✅ Working
- **Details**: Successfully created a team with the provided payload. The endpoint properly validates input and returns the team ID and name in the response.

### 3. GET /api/teams/{team_id} (get team details)
- **Status**: ✅ Working
- **Details**: Returns detailed team information including name, logo, colors, location, captain details, and team members with their information.

### 4. POST /api/teams/{team_id}/invite (invite player)
- **Status**: ✅ Working
- **Details**: Successfully sent an invitation to the admin user and returned the invitation ID. The endpoint properly validates that only the team captain can send invitations.

### 5. GET /api/teams/my-invitations (get invitations)
- **Status**: ❌ Not Working
- **Details**: When testing with the admin user who was invited to a team, the endpoint returned a 404 error with 'Team not found' message. After investigating the database, we found that the invitation status was already set to "accepted", but the endpoint is only looking for invitations with status "PENDING". The error message "Team not found" is misleading and doesn't accurately reflect the actual issue.

### 6. POST /api/teams/invitations/{invitation_id}/accept (accept invitation)
- **Status**: ✅ Working
- **Details**: Successfully accepted the invitation using the invitation ID, and the admin user was added to the team. Verified that the team now has 2 members including the admin user.

## Issue Details

The GET /api/teams/my-invitations endpoint is not working correctly. When testing with the admin user who was invited to a team, the endpoint returned a 404 error with 'Team not found' message.

Response:
```
Status: 404
Response: {"detail":"Team not found"}
```

After investigating the database, we found that:
1. The invitation exists in the database with ID "736372e3-81a3-44db-aba1-8337ae8dae9f"
2. The invitation status is set to "accepted" (not "PENDING")
3. The endpoint is only looking for invitations with status "PENDING"
4. The error message "Team not found" is misleading and doesn't accurately reflect the actual issue

The code in the endpoint is:
```python
invitations = list(team_invitations_collection.find({
    "invited_user_id": user_id,
    "status": InvitationStatus.PENDING,
    "expires_at": {"$gt": datetime.utcnow()}  # Not expired
}))
```

## Recommendations

1. Fix the GET /api/teams/my-invitations endpoint to handle the case when no invitations are found more gracefully (return an empty list instead of a 404 error)
2. Consider adding an option to retrieve all invitations (both pending and accepted) with a query parameter
3. Fix the error message to be more accurate (e.g., "No pending invitations found" instead of "Team not found")

## Action Items for Main Agent

- Fix the GET /api/teams/my-invitations endpoint to handle the case when no invitations are found more gracefully (return an empty list instead of a 404 error)
- Fix the error message to be more accurate (e.g., "No pending invitations found" instead of "Team not found")
- Consider adding an option to retrieve all invitations (both pending and accepted) with a query parameter
