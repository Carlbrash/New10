# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "Test the new Team System backend endpoints that were just implemented.

Please test the following Team System endpoints:

1. Test GET /api/teams (list all teams - should be empty initially)

2. Test POST /api/teams (create team) with testuser credentials:
   - Login as testuser (testuser/test123)
   - Create a team with payload:
   ```json
   {
     \"name\": \"Test Warriors\",
     \"logo_url\": \"https://example.com/logo.png\",
     \"colors\": {
       \"primary\": \"#FF0000\",
       \"secondary\": \"#FFFFFF\"
     },
     \"city\": \"Athens\",
     \"country\": \"Greece\", 
     \"phone\": \"+30123456789\",
     \"email\": \"testwarriors@example.com\"
   }
   ```

3. Test GET /api/teams again to see the created team

4. Test GET /api/teams/{team_id} to get team details

5. Test POST /api/teams/{team_id}/invite (invite player):
   - Try to invite \"admin\" user to the team

6. Test with admin user:
   - Login as admin (admin/Kiki1999@)
   - GET /api/teams/my-invitations (should show invitation from testuser)
   - POST /api/teams/invitations/{invitation_id}/accept (accept the invitation)

This will test the core team creation, invitation, and acceptance flow."

Most endpoints are working correctly, including team creation, team listing, team details, inviting players, and accepting invitations. However, there is an issue with the GET /api/teams/my-invitations endpoint, which returns a 404 'Team not found' error when trying to retrieve invitations for the admin user. After investigating the database, I found that the invitation status was already set to 'accepted', but the endpoint is only looking for invitations with status 'PENDING'. The error message 'Team not found' is misleading and doesn't accurately reflect the actual issue. The endpoint should handle the case when no invitations are found more gracefully (return an empty list instead of a 404 error) and provide a more accurate error message."
