The AI engineer's work involved a comprehensive, iterative enhancement of the SportsDuel feature, transforming it into a Live Scores module within the WoBeRa application. Initially, the focus was on delivering a professional live scoreboard with 1v1 match display, accurate progress bars, compact design, and search functionality. User feedback consistently drove the development, leading to a complete overhaul of the  function and associated  for a professional digital design. Key changes included advanced filtering, visual indicators (red/green dots, then photo borders), revised score/logo positioning, and match day context. The process involved fixing a critical login issue that hindered frontend verification. The latest iteration introduced a two-level UI: an initial livescores list view with match times, teams, scores, and status indicators, which then transitions to the detailed 1v1 match view upon selection. All requested refinements, from green LIVE indicators to dynamic filtering, were successfully implemented and verified through screenshots.

The WoBeRa platform aims to elevate its gaming/esports experience through the SportsDuel feature, now rebranded as Live Scores. The core problem is to provide a professional, highly functional, and visually appealing live sports betting interface.

Initial requirements for the detailed match view included:
1.  **1v1 Match Display**: Accurate representation of individual player matches contributing to overall team scores (e.g., 15-19 team score reflects individual player wins).
2.  **Progress Bars**: Percentage-based, color-coded progress bars (e.g., 2.30/5.20) for player performance.
3.  **Compact Design**: Scoreboard cards to efficiently display hundreds of simultaneous matches.
4.  **Search Functionality**: Ability to search for teams/players.

Subsequent user feedback demanded a more professional, digital redesign, incorporating:
5.  **Enhanced Visuals**: Red/green indicators (initially dots, later glowing photo borders), user photos, records, and clear separation of scores/logos/team names.
6.  **Contextual Information**: Displaying specific match day (e.g., 10th Agonistiki) instead of broad region (Europe) and organization names.
7.  **Advanced Filtering**: Sub-menu for country, organization, and game type.
8.  **UI Refinements**: Static Vs indicator, specific color adjustments for percentages (purple to white), and inclusion of upcoming matches.
9.  **Two-Level UI**: An initial livescores list view (displaying time, teams, logos, scores, league, matchday, live 1v1 count, status) from which clicking an event opens the detailed 1v1 match view.
10. **Navigation/Text Changes**: SportsDuel menu item changed to Live Scores.
11. **Status Indicators**: Green circle for live, grey for pending, FIN for finished, below match time.
12. **Localization**: Match day text (10η Αγωνιστική) to be in English (10th Matchday).
13. **Filter Functionality**: Filters for Country, Organization, Game, and Status (Finished, Live, Upcoming, All), with Live as default.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully completed a series of significant UI/UX refinements for the **SportsDuel live scoreboard**, which is now functioning as a comprehensive Live Scores interface. This work was driven by continuous, detailed user feedback following an initial major redesign.

The engineer addressed several specific points:
1.  **Login Process**: The critical login issue preventing frontend access and visual verification was fully resolved, allowing seamless navigation to the SportsDuel section.
2.  **LIVE Indicator**: The LIVE badge color was changed from red to green in  (specifically  and related animations).
3.  **Score and Logo Positioning**: The layout for team scores and logos was adjusted in  and . For the second team, the score now appears before the team name (e.g., 19 GLYFADA SHARKS), and the team logo is placed after the team name. For the first team, the logo is before the name and score after the name.
4.  **Country/Region Display**: The GR and ES (for Greece and Spain) are now displayed in uppercase and positioned correctly below the team logos.
5.  **Percentage Color**: The color of the success percentage indicators was changed from purple to white in .
6.  **Player Status Indicator**: The red/green dots for player status were replaced with glowing green/red borders around player photos in  and .
7.  **Match Day Display**: The tournament context was updated to display specific match day information (e.g., 10th Matchday) instead of broad regions, with mock data in  updated accordingly.
8.  **Static Vs**: The Vs indicator was made static, removing previous animations that caused visual distraction.
9.  **Two-Level UI Implementation**: A new livescores list view was created as the initial SportsDuel display. This list shows matches with times, team logos, names, live scores, league, matchday, and a live 1v1 count. This involved significant  and  modifications for rendering and styling.
10. **Navigation Text**: The SportsDuel menu item was updated to Live Scores.
11. **Status Indicators**: New status indicators (green dot for live, grey for upcoming, FIN for finished) were added below the match time in the list view.
12. **Filtering Enhancements**: The filtering system was made fully functional with a correct order (Country, Organization, Game, Status), and the Live status was set as the default filter.

All these changes have been implemented and visually verified through screenshots, resulting in a 100% professional and digital Live Scores interface as per user's requests.
