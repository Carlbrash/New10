The AI engineer successfully took over the WoBeRa application development, initially focusing on crucial UI/UX fixes like broken navigation menus and misaligned layouts by adjusting  and . A methodical, iterative approach was consistently followed.

Following the initial fixes, the engineer implemented a comprehensive Content Management System (CMS) involving new MongoDB models, FastAPI CRUD endpoints, and frontend integration. Subsequently, several CSS-related UI issues were resolved, including the admin panel, Affiliate Program page, and League Management page, debugging a critical CSS syntax error along the way.

The trajectory then shifted to resolving pending tasks: Recent Activity Section Fix Verification and Friend Search Functionality Fix. The AI engineer prioritized and successfully implemented the Friend Search fix by refactoring frontend state management () to use a dedicated  for the friends modal, resolving a  state conflict. This was confirmed by screenshots and backend API testing.

Currently, the AI engineer is actively working on a new major feature: the SportsDuel system. This involves creating new backend models and API endpoints for leagues, teams, players, matches, and coupons, and integrating the basic frontend structure, states, functions, and initial CSS for the scoreboard and associated UI.

<product_requirements>
The user is tasked with enhancing the WoBeRa platform, a gaming and esports application, by fixing existing UI/UX issues and adding new features. Initial requirements focused on rectifying visual inconsistencies:
1.  **Navigation Fixes**: Correcting misalignment post-login and compression in the admin dashboard.
2.  **Wallet Dashboard Fix**: Addressing broken layout and styling.
3.  **Recent Activity Section Fix**: Resolving visual glitches.

Subsequent requests expanded functionality:
4.  **Admin CMS Tool**: Implementation for dynamic content management (text, fonts, colors).
5.  **Admin Panel Refinement**: Further CSS adjustments for menus and image sizing.
6.  **Affiliate Program Page Styling**: Enhancing visual presentation with professional layouts.
7.  **League Management/Standings Page Styling**: Fixing layout and appearance of country cards.

Most recently, a significant new feature, **SportsDuel,** was requested. This system will organize sports betting leagues where sports cafes form teams and their customers act as players. Matches are 1v1, with winners determined by fewer wrong predictions, or higher combined odds in a tie (at least one winning choice required). The user provided a screenshot for a professional sports-style scoreboard UI, indicating desired elements like team logos, player cards with photos/stats, and a scoring system.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively implementing the SportsDuel feature. This involves a comprehensive build across both backend and frontend.

On the **backend ()**, new MongoDB collections and Pydantic models for  entities like Leagues, Teams, Players, Matches, Coupons, and Bets have been defined. Essential helper functions for game logic, such as  and , are also in place. A full suite of RESTful API endpoints has been created to manage these entities, including creating/retrieving leagues, teams, matches, coupons, and updating match results, along with an endpoint for a live scoreboard. A function to initialize sample data for testing purposes was also added.

On the **frontend ()**, the initial structural elements for SportsDuel have been integrated. This includes adding a new SportsDuel navigation menu item, defining necessary React states (e.g., , , ), and adding the skeletal functions for interacting with the new backend APIs (e.g., , ). A dedicated  function has been created as a placeholder for the main UI component.

The very last action in the trajectory was the initiation of **CSS styling ()** for the SportsDuel feature, which is still in progress. The goal is to bring the scoreboard and other UI elements to life with a professional, sports-themed design as requested by the user's screenshot.
