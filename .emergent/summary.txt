The AI engineer successfully progressed the WoBeRa application development through several phases. Initially, critical UI/UX issues were addressed in  and . This was followed by the implementation of a comprehensive Content Management System using MongoDB, FastAPI, and React. Key UI elements like the admin panel and specific page stylings were subsequently refined. A significant Friend Search Functionality bug was resolved by refactoring React state management.

The core of the recent work revolved around the SportsDuel feature, encompassing backend model and API creation () and initial frontend integration (, ). User feedback then shifted to extensive content creation for the homepage's Who We Are section, detailing the WoBeRa organization, Championship Schedule, and advanced player features, all implemented in  and styled in . The final iterations focused on highly detailed refinements of the SportsDuel live scoreboard UI/UX, incorporating specific user requests for logo appearance, player information display, and layout compactness, including the integration of real 3D logos and player photos. The current state is that the scoreboard UI is aligned with the user's detailed design requests.

The objective is to enhance the WoBeRa gaming/esports platform. Initial requirements included fixing UI/UX issues like misaligned navigation, broken wallet layouts, and visual glitches in the Recent Activity section. Subsequent features added an Admin CMS tool for dynamic content, refined admin panel styling, and improved the visual presentation of Affiliate Program and League Management pages.

A major feature, SportsDuel, was requested to facilitate sports betting leagues where sports cafes form teams and customers play. This involved defining league, team, player, match, and coupon structures, and creating a professional sports-style scoreboard UI with specific elements like team logos, player cards, and a scoring system.

Further content additions to the homepage included a Who We Are section detailing WoBeRa's global/local organizational structure, Alpha Planet network, team participation, and player rules. A Championship Schedule section was added to explain the synchronized fixture system with professional leagues and points. Advanced features like National Team creation, Friendly Games, Player Transfer Values, Player Transfers, and Player Tournaments were also specified. Most recently, the focus has been on iteratively refining the SportsDuel live scoreboard, requiring specific visual details for team logos, player stats (e.g., 2.30/5.20 performance), and layout.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard full-stack architecture:


-   **/app/frontend/src/App.css**:
    -   **Summary**: The central stylesheet that defines the application's visual appearance and user experience.
    -   **Changes Made**: This file has undergone extensive modifications throughout the development trajectory. Initially, it received fixes for navigation, wallet, and admin panel styling. Significant additions were made for the Affiliate Program and League Management pages. More recently, it has been heavily modified to support the SportsDuel system's scoreboard design, the various sections of the Who We Are content (Global Authority, Teams, Championship Schedule, Advanced Features), and dashboard statistics card improvements. The latest changes focused on fine-tuning the SportsDuel scoreboard's visual elements, including team logo sizing/fit, country flag visibility, and player layout, as well as integrating real image styling.

-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Summary**: The main React component that manages application routing, state, and UI rendering logic.
    -   **Changes Made**: This file has been consistently updated to reflect new features and UI/UX improvements. Early changes included dynamic navbar assignments and integration of CMS state variables and rendering. The Friend Search Fix involved introducing a  state to resolve conflicts. The SportsDuel feature saw the addition of new navigation, React states (, ), and API interaction functions (). Critically, the  function was iteratively developed and refined to implement the complex scoreboard UI, including detailed match cards, player sections, and live statistics. Furthermore, the homepage () was significantly expanded to include the Who We Are sections (WoBeRa Global Authority, Teams, Championship Schedule, National Team, Friendly Games, Player Transfer Value/Transfers, Player Tournaments).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was deep into the iterative refinement of the **SportsDuel live scoreboard UI** on the frontend, specifically within  and .

The user provided direct, detailed feedback following previous iterations of the scoreboard. The AI engineer was addressing several crucial points:
1.  **Team Logos**: Correcting the sizing and fit within their circular/rounded frames, ensuring proper aspect ratio () and visual clarity, rather than being too large or distorted. The size was specifically adjusted to  with an  border-radius and a white background.
2.  **Country Flags**: Enhancing their visibility, as they were previously obscured by a white background. This involved adding a dark, semi-transparent background () to make them stand out.
3.  **Upcoming Players Layout**: Fixing the erroneous vertical stacking of players. The user requested a horizontal, side-by-side display for players from opposing teams in the Upcoming section, which was implemented using a  grid () to display Team 1 players on the left and Team 2 players on the right.
4.  **Overall Card Size**: Making the entire match card structure more compact and aesthetically pleasing, reducing  to  and adjusting padding and component spacing.
5.  **Missing Live Player Information**: Crucially, adding a live performance metric for each player (e.g., 2.30/5.20) to indicate their current score against a maximum potential score. This includes color-coded indicators (green for up, red for down, yellow for stable) and trend arrows (üìà, üìâ, ‚û°Ô∏è).

The last action recorded (Chat Message 196) describes the successful completion and verification of these specific UI/UX improvements, indicating that the scoreboard now presents all requested critical information in a compact and visually appealing manner, distinguishing between overall match scores and live player performance.
