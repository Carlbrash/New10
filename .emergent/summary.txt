The previous AI engineer successfully brought the WoBeRa application from MVP to a feature-rich platform. Initial efforts focused on fixing the Manual Adjustment modal, which suffered from persistent frontend rendering and DOM placement issues, eventually resolved by moving the modal to the root level and correcting CSS and API URL inconsistencies. Subsequently, a comprehensive Team Management System was designed and implemented, including team creation, invitations, and member management. Following this, the user requested significant UI/UX enhancements, grouped into a Visual Impact phase. The AI engineer proceeded to implement a Toast Notification system, Loading Skeletons, and integrate Smooth Animations using Framer-Motion. The work immediately preceding this summary involved applying the final typography and spacing polish, making the application visually more appealing. The engineer demonstrated strong debugging skills and effective communication, guiding the user through complex feature implementations and visual improvements.

The WoBeRa (World Betting Rank) Platform is a luxury sports betting federation with a black/blue/gold theme, JWT authentication, and bilingual (Greek/English) support. It features an Admin Panel for user/content management and analytics, and user-facing features like rankings, login/registration, settings, and a home page. A core Tournament System allows users to view, join, and participate in single-elimination tournaments. Additional features include an Affiliate System for referrals and commissions, and a Financial Management System with a User Wallet Dashboard and Admin Financial Overview (manual adjustments, transaction tracking, payout management).

The most recent major feature request was a **Team Management System**:
- Each player can create one team of 11 to 20 general players.
- The team Captain (creator) sends invitations; players accept to join.
- Players can only be in one team and can only transfer with Captain's consent and a transfer fee.
- Teams have unique global names, logos, colors (from a 12-color panel), city, country, phone, and email.
- The team form has 11 empty slots for invited players.
- Teams gain official recognition and can participate in team tournaments only after Wobera admin approval.
- There will be a team messaging system (Captain to players).
- Teams will have a separate global and national ranking system based on victories and tournament placements. Admins can also create National Teams and invite players for those.

Following the team system, the user requested **Visual & UI Upgrades**:
- Implementation of a Toast Notifications system.
- Addition of Loading Skeletons.
- Smooth Animations using Framer-Motion.
- Better Typography and Spacing.

        - **Tournament, Affiliate, Financial Management**: Existing models and endpoints for these systems were present and updated iteratively throughout the project.
        - **Team System**: New Pydantic models (, , ) were introduced. Corresponding API endpoints were added for team creation (), listing teams (), retrieving team details (), inviting players (), and managing invitations (, , ).
        - **Bug Fixes**: Corrected an  parameter error in  function and implemented logic to allow manual adjustments by both user ID and username.

- ****:
    - **Importance**: The main React component managing the application's UI, routing, global state, and API interactions.
    - **Changes Made**:
        - **Tournament, Affiliate, Financial Management**: UI components, states, and functions for these systems were integrated and refined.
        - **Manual Adjustment Modal Fix**: The modal's rendering logic and DOM placement were extensively debugged and moved to the root level to resolve visibility issues.
        - **User Settings Enhancements**: Added display of User ID with a copy button next to the photo upload field in settings.
        - **Team System Integration**:
            - Added  menu item to main and mobile navigation.
            - Implemented state management (, , , ).
            - Created  function to display teams list, create team form, and manage invitations.
            - Integrated API calls for team creation, invitations, and team details.
        - **UI/UX Improvements**:
            - **Toast Notifications**: Implemented  function and integrated a  component, replacing native  calls.
            - **Loading Skeletons**: Introduced , , , , and  components, integrating them into relevant sections (Teams, Tournaments, Rankings) to enhance perceived loading performance.
            - **Smooth Animations**: Integrated  for page transitions, card hover effects, button interactions, and modal animations.
        - **Bug Fixes**: Resolved multiple duplicate state and function declarations (e.g., , , ) to ensure proper component behavior and prevent linting errors. Fixed API URL inconsistencies by standardizing  usage.

- ****:
    - **Importance**: Provides custom CSS styles, adhering to the black/blue/gold theme and ensuring responsiveness.
    - **Changes Made**:
        - Extensive styling for all new features: Tournament, Affiliate, Financial, and Team systems.
        - Aggressive modifications for manual adjustment modal visibility (e.g., high z-index, strong backgrounds) during debugging.
        - New styles for:
            - **Toast Notifications**: Styles for different toast types (success, error, warning, info), progress bars, and animations (slide-in, hover effects).
            - **Loading Skeletons**: Animations for shimmer and pulse effects, and styling for various skeleton components to mimic content structure.
            - **Framer-Motion Animations**: Supporting CSS for hover effects, button ripples, and other visual enhancements integrated with framer-motion.
            - **Typography and Spacing**: Refinements for font hierarchy, consistent spacing, line heights, and overall visual polish.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in significant UI/UX enhancements for the WoBeRa application, specifically focusing on the Visual Impact phase as requested by the user. This phase was broken down into four steps:

1.  **Toast Notifications System**: This was successfully completed. All native  calls were replaced with a professional, animated toast notification system that supports success, error, warning, and info types, featuring smooth slide-in/out animations, auto-dismiss functionality, and interactive elements.
2.  **Loading Skeletons**: This step was also completed. The application now displays custom skeleton screens (e.g., , ) with shimmer and pulse animations in sections like Teams, Tournaments, and Rankings, enhancing the perceived loading performance.
3.  **Smooth Animations with Framer-Motion**: This was integrated and completed. The  library was added, enabling smooth page transitions, interactive card hover effects, dynamic button interactions (scale, ripple, bounce), and refined modal animations with backdrop blur.
4.  **Better Typography & Spacing Polish**: This is the current and final step of the Visual Impact phase. The engineer was in the process of applying enhanced CSS styles to refine the application's typography (font hierarchy, line heights) and ensure consistent spacing across UI elements for a more professional and polished appearance. The last action performed was applying these final CSS improvements.

The application is in a state where these visual enhancements have been applied, and a restart of the frontend service is pending to load them fully for user verification.

<optional_next_step>
I will restart the frontend service to apply the final typography and spacing changes, then provide the user with the URL to test the completed Visual Impact enhancements.
