The previous AI engineer successfully initiated and developed core functionalities for the WoBeRa application. The work commenced with integrating a comprehensive payment system (Stripe, PayPal, Cryptocurrency) for tournament entry fees and payouts, involving significant backend (FastAPI, MongoDB) and frontend (React) development. A critical frontend authentication bug was systematically identified and resolved, enabling full testing. Subsequently, a social sharing system was built, providing backend endpoints for sharing tournament and achievement content. Most recently, the engineer redesigned the team cards for a modern aesthetic and is currently addressing user feedback to optimize their layout for better space utilization, aiming for a three-column arrangement. The trajectory shows a methodical approach, including detailed planning, dependency management, and iterative testing after each major implementation or fix.

<product_requirements>
The initial request was to  development on an existing MVP. The first explicit feature requested was a **Payment Integration** supporting Stripe, PayPal, and cryptocurrency for tournament entry fees and payouts. This required full-stack implementation, including backend APIs for payment sessions, payouts, and admin management, and a React frontend for UI and history. After this, the user requested **Integration Expansions**, specifically focusing on a **Social Sharing System** for sharing tournament victories, team formations, and achievements. Following the social sharing backend, the user explicitly requested a redesign of the ugly and temporary team cards to be beautiful, modern with social sharing functionality. The very latest feedback, provided in Greek, was to make the redesigned team cards more compact, arranging them in threes to better utilize screen space and prevent truncated descriptions, as there wouldn't be too many teams.

<current_work>
The product currently features a fully functional payment system, allowing users to pay tournament entry fees via Stripe, PayPal, or cryptocurrency, and enabling winner payouts. An admin interface is available for payment management and refunds. A social sharing system is also integrated, with a robust backend capable of generating shareable content for tournament victories, team formations, and achievements, with associated API endpoints for tracking.

The immediate work is focused on enhancing the user interface, specifically addressing the layout of the team cards. The previous AI engineer performed a significant visual overhaul of the team cards in  and  to make them modern and aesthetically pleasing, including gradient backgrounds, enhanced typography, and a Share Formation button that triggers a social sharing modal.

However, the user provided feedback (in Greek) stating that while the cards are beautiful, they occupy too much space, suggesting a more compact arrangement of three cards per row. The AI engineer acknowledged this, recognizing the current layout presents only two cards per row, and has just made an edit to address this spacing issue, planning to arrange them in triples. The last action was an edit to the frontend, likely a CSS adjustment, followed by a frontend restart to apply this layout change.
