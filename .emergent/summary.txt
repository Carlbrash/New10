The AI engineer's work, originating from the SportsDuel feature, evolved into a comprehensive Live Scores and subsequently a full application UI/UX overhaul, primarily focused on the frontend. The process was iterative, with constant user feedback driving enhancements. Initial work delivered a professional live scoreboard with filtering and visual indicators. Subsequent phases involved a complete menu reorganization, moving Teams and Friends under Guilds, and Affiliate and Wallets under Settings. A complex, multi-level Settings dropdown was designed and implemented, featuring user info, balances, and nested submenus, along with a functional Deposit button routing to the wallet. Critical UI issues like text truncation and element overlaps were addressed. A robust browser-history-based back navigation system was developed and debugged. Finally, the Chat send button was fixed, and a new Standings section was introduced with a country-selection grid, poised for detailed league/match data integration.

The WoBeRa platform aims to provide a professional and visually appealing esports/gaming interface, evolving its SportsDuel feature into a Live Scores module, and enhancing core navigation. The initial goal for Live Scores was a 1v1 match display with progress bars, compact design, and search. User feedback led to a professional digital design with enhanced visuals (glowing photo borders), contextual match day info, advanced filtering (country, organization, game, status), a two-level UI (list view to detailed 1v1), and specific status indicators (green LIVE, grey upcoming, FIN finished).

Recent requirements expanded to a complete menu reorganization: Teams and Friends under Guilds; Affiliate and Wallets under Settings. The main menu order was strictly defined: Dashboard, Rankings, Guilds, Tournaments, Live Scores, Standings, Chat, Settings. A highly detailed Settings dropdown was requested, including user balance, a Deposit button, Withdrawable and Bet Credits displays, and four main options (Account, Alerts, My Offers, Preferences), with Account having its own submenu (Bank, Messages, My Account, Rules, My Activity, History, Affiliate). Furthermore, improved icons were requested, and a back navigation feature was added. The Chat send button required a fix. Lastly, the Standings section needs a redesign akin to Live Scores, displaying active championships by country, with a detailed view upon clicking a country to show schedules and historical results, not live scores.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was actively working on enhancing the application's UI/UX based on the user's iterative feedback. The most recent completed tasks involved significant improvements to the Standings section and a fix for the Chat interface.

For **Standings**, the engineer implemented a new initial view () that displays a grid of available countries (e.g., Greece, Italy, England, Germany, Spain, France), each with their active/coming soon season status and league buttons (e.g., PREMIER LEAGUE, LEAGUE 2). This new UI is designed to be visually appealing and organized, similar to the Live Scores style, but intended for match schedules and historical results. Upon clicking a country, the UI correctly navigates to a detailed view for that specific country, although the detailed content currently displays a No data available message. This foundational UI and navigation for Standings is now in place.

For the **Chat** interface, the issue where the Send button was cut off and not fully clickable was resolved by adjusting its CSS styling in . The chat popup now presents correctly with a fully visible and functional Send button.

Prior to these, major work included:
-   A complete menu reorganization and reordering in  to: Dashboard, Rankings, Guilds (with Teams & Friends submenus), Tournaments, Live Scores, Standings, Chat, Settings.
-   Development of an advanced Settings dropdown, providing user details (username, wallet balance), a functional Deposit button (navigating to the wallet page), Withdrawable and Bet Credits displays, and a multi-level submenu for Account (Bank, Messages, My Account, Rules, My Activity, History, Affiliate).
-   Resolution of a UI overlap where the language selector interfered with the Settings dropdown by adjusting positioning and  in  and adding dynamic hiding logic in .
-   Implementation of a reliable browser-history-based Back button using  for seamless navigation.
-   Consistent icon updates across the Settings and Standings sections for a more professional look.

The next step is to populate the detailed Standings view with mock data for England to test its full interface.
