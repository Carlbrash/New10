The AI engineer's work primarily focused on enhancing the WoBeRa application, particularly the SportsDuel feature. Initial efforts involved addressing general UI/UX issues and implementing a Content Management System. The core of this trajectory involved iteratively developing and refining the SportsDuel live scoreboard, incorporating detailed user feedback on match structure (transitioning from implied team-vs-team to explicit 1v1 player matches within team scores), accurate progress bar display, card compactness for scalability, and adding search functionality. The development cycle included multiple rounds of code modifications in  and , bug fixing (ESLint, CSS syntax), and environment troubleshooting. Despite a successful backend test and an earlier self-summary of completion, direct user feedback revealed persistent frontend layout issues, leading to a final round of CSS corrections to ensure the scoreboard visually matched user expectations.

The WoBeRa platform aims to enhance its gaming/esports experience. Initial phases addressed UI/UX fixes (navigation, wallet, activity sections) and introduced an Admin CMS. A key feature, SportsDuel, was requested for sports betting leagues, requiring defined league/team/player/match/coupon structures and a professional live scoreboard UI. User requirements specified accurate display of 1v1 individual player matches within team competitions (e.g., 15-19 team score indicating 15 wins by team 1 players and 19 by team 2 players in 1v1 matches). Progress bars for player performance (e.g., 2.30/5.20) needed to show accurate percentages with color-coding and remaining white fill, not full green. The scoreboard cards required a compact design to accommodate hundreds of simultaneous matches, and a search functionality for teams/players was essential.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing persistent layout issues within the **SportsDuel live scoreboard UI** in . Despite a previous summary claiming completion and backend testing success, the user explicitly requested to fix the CSS, indicating visual discrepancies.

The AI engineer acknowledged these layout issues, which likely stemmed from an inaccurate previous assessment of the frontend's visual state. The specific CSS fixes implemented to resolve these issues included:
1.  **Header Stats Structure**: Restored correct  styling (gap, font-size, color) and proper  and  styling with pulse animations.
2.  **Match Card Layout**: Improved  with appropriate  values (450px) and enhanced  with better padding and backgrounds.
