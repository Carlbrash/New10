The AI engineer successfully transitioned into the WoBeRa application development, a gaming and esports platform. The initial phase focused on understanding the environment and resolving critical UI/UX issues, including a broken navigation menu for both regular and admin users, and a misaligned Wallet dashboard layout, primarily by adjusting CSS in  and dynamic class assignment in . A methodical, iterative approach with testing via screenshots was consistently applied.

Subsequently, the engineer addressed new user requests. The major undertaking was the implementation of a comprehensive Content Management System (CMS), covering both backend (new MongoDB models, FastAPI CRUD endpoints, datetime serialization fixes) and frontend (admin interface, dynamic content integration, styling). Following this, the engineer tackled several CSS-related UI fixes: correcting the admin panel menu layout, styling the Affiliate Program page, and finally, rectifying the League Management/Standings page, including debugging a critical CSS syntax error during the Affiliate Program fix. The engineer consistently communicated progress and confirmed fixes with the user.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully addressed the styling issues on the **League Management/Standings page**. The user reported problems with the layout, spacing, and appearance of country cards.

The AI engineer applied comprehensive CSS changes to , adding styles for the , , , , and  classes. These additions focused on creating a professional appearance with:
*   Gradient backgrounds for the admin panel.
*   Beautiful cards for each country with flags and league status.
*   Color-coded league status badges (e.g., Gold for Premier, Blue for League 2).
*   Professional search bar with focus effects.

Furthermore, responsive CSS was added to ensure optimal display on mobile (768px, single column grid) and small mobile (480px, ultra-compact) devices, including vertical stacking for headers and full-width buttons. After these changes and a frontend restart, the League Management page now boasts an enterprise-level design, making it visually appealing and functional for admin users.
