The AI engineer's work revolved around iteratively enhancing the SportsDuel feature within the WoBeRa application. Initially, general UI/UX improvements and a CMS were implemented. The primary focus then shifted to the SportsDuel live scoreboard, which required accurate 1v1 player match representation within team scores, precise progress bars, compact card design, and search functionality. User feedback was crucial, leading to multiple  and  modifications. Despite backend testing success and initial frontend fixes, direct user feedback indicated persistent dissatisfaction with the scoreboard's visual design. This prompted a significant redesign phase, including a complete overhaul of the  function and associated CSS for a professional digital design. The engineer implemented advanced filtering, visual indicators (red/green dots, player photos, records), and refined layout elements. The current work is focused on further refining this new design based on the *latest* user feedback, specifically on score layout, upcoming matches, color schemes, and static Vs indicators, although the login process is currently hindering visual verification.

<product_requirements>
The WoBeRa platform aims to improve its gaming/esports experience, specifically with the SportsDuel feature for sports betting leagues. Initial requirements included a defined structure for leagues, teams, players, matches, and coupons, alongside a professional live scoreboard UI. Key functionalities required:
1.  **1v1 Match Display**: Accurate representation of individual player matches contributing to team scores (e.g., 15-19 team score means 15 wins by Team 1 players, 19 by Team 2 players in 1v1 matches).
2.  **Progress Bars**: Percentage-based progress bars for player performance (e.g., 2.30/5.20), showing accurate percentages with color-coding and remaining white fill.
3.  **Compact Design**: Scoreboard cards must be compact to handle hundreds of simultaneous matches.
4.  **Search Functionality**: Ability to search for teams/players.
Recent feedback indicates a desire for a more professional, more digital design, including:
5.  **Enhanced Visuals**: Red dot for loser, green for winner (or player photo border), user photos with records, beautifully separated scores/logos/team names.
6.  **Contextual Information**: Match day (e.g., 10th Agonistiki) instead of broad region (Europe), organization names.
7.  **Advanced Filtering**: A sub-menu below search for quick filtering by country, organization, and game type.
8.  **UI Refinements**: Static Vs animation, specific color adjustments for percentage indicators, and adding upcoming matches.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture**: React (frontend) for UI, FastAPI (backend) for API and logic, MongoDB (database) for data storage.
-   **State Management**: React's  for dynamic UI updates and comprehensive filtering.
-   **API Interaction**: RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations on SportsDuel entities (, , , etc.).
-   **Styling**: Extensive CSS for responsive layouts, animated elements, and detailed visual indicators.
-   **Data Modeling**: Pydantic models in FastAPI for structured data validation.

<code_architecture>


-   **/app/frontend/src/App.css**:
    -   **Summary**: The primary stylesheet governing the application's visual appearance. It dictates UI/UX elements, layout, and responsiveness.
    -   **Changes Made**: This file has undergone extensive modifications throughout the development trajectory. Initially, it was tweaked for general UI issues and then heavily refined for the SportsDuel scoreboard, focusing on team logo sizing, player layout, and card compactness. Most recently, it was completely updated to support the new professional digital design of the SportsDuel scoreboard, including new styles for team scoreboards, player cards, progress bars, and filters, ensuring a modern and clean aesthetic with precise positioning and alignment of elements.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Summary**: The main React component, responsible for application routing, managing global state, and rendering UI components.
    -   **Changes Made**: This file has been continuously updated. For SportsDuel, the  function was completely refactored to implement 1v1 match logic, accurate percentage-based progress bars, compact card rendering, and initial search functionality ( state). Following recent user feedback, the *entire return statement* of  was replaced to introduce a significantly redesigned layout and structure. New  variables were added for advanced filtering (country, organization, game), and the filtering logic itself was updated to accommodate these new criteria. Minor bug fixes, such as correcting tournament property access, were also applied.
-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Summary**: The FastAPI backend server that exposes API endpoints and handles interactions with the MongoDB database.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated to support the SportsDuel feature by introducing new MongoDB collections and Pydantic models for entities like , , and . It includes various API endpoints, such as  for creating leagues and  for fetching live match data. Helper functions for game logic and result management () have also been implemented.
-   **/app/test_result.md**:
    -   **Summary**: This markdown file serves as a comprehensive log, recording user problem statements, testing protocols, testing data, and communication records from previous interactions. It's crucial for guiding the testing process.
    -   **Changes Made**: Continuously updated to reflect the outcomes of backend API testing for SportsDuel features and subsequent visual verification attempts for the frontend. It captures the iterative feedback loop, including the user's initial dissatisfaction with the SportsDuel design that led to the current redesign efforts.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Login Process for Frontend Verification**: The automated login process needs to be functional to reliably access and visually verify the SportsDuel frontend.
-   **Recent Activity Section Fix Verification**: The CSS changes previously applied to this section were not explicitly confirmed for display or functionality.
-   **Payment Modal Frontend Integration**: Identified as a future improvement area but not yet addressed.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in a major redesign effort for the **SportsDuel live scoreboard UI** in  and . This work was initiated due to explicit user dissatisfaction with the previous design, stating it was very far from what I gave you as a mockup.

The engineer's actions involved:
1.  **Re-evaluation**: Rereading  to find original requirements and mockups (though no image assets were found).
2.  **Code Analysis**: Inspecting existing  (specifically ) and  to understand the current, unsatisfactory implementation.
3.  **Detailed User Feedback Collection**: Directly asking the user for specific design improvements, which yielded a comprehensive list of desired changes.
4.  **Major UI Overhaul**:
    *   **Filtering System**: Implementation of advanced filtering states (country, organization, game) and updating the filtering logic within .
    *   **Rendering Logic Refactor**: Replacement of the *entire return statement* within  in  to implement the new professional digital design. This included a new structure for match cards, team scoreboards, and player information display.
    *   **Styling Update**: Creation/modification of extensive CSS rules in  to match the new visual style, incorporating elements like improved spacing, typography, and visual indicators.
    *   **Minor Fixes**: Correcting data access (e.g., ).
5.  **Verification Attempt**: Trying to take screenshots of the updated SportsDuel UI, which revealed a persistent issue with the automated login process, preventing access to the SportsDuel section itself.

The immediate state is that the core design overhaul based on the *first round* of detailed user feedback (professional digital design, intelligent indicators, enhanced player info, better team separation, organization names, advanced filtering) has been implemented in code. However, visual verification is stalled by the login issue. Furthermore, the user provided *another round* of refinements (red to green live indicator, score placement, upcoming matches, purple to white percentage, photo border instead of dot, match day instead of Europe, static Vs), which the AI has just begun to address by updating score layout and status indicator.
