# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "Test the new Team System backend endpoints that were just implemented.

Please test the following Team System endpoints:

1. Test GET /api/teams (list all teams - should be empty initially)

2. Test POST /api/teams (create team) with testuser credentials:
   - Login as testuser (testuser/test123)
   - Create a team with payload:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "Test Warriors",
     "logo_url": "https://example.com/logo.png",
     "colors": {
       "primary": "#FF0000",
       "secondary": "#FFFFFF"
     },
     "city": "Athens",
     "country": "Greece", 
     "phone": "+30123456789",
     "email": "testwarriors@example.com"
   }
   ```

3. Test GET /api/teams again to see the created team

4. Test GET /api/teams/{team_id} to get team details

5. Test POST /api/teams/{team_id}/invite (invite player):
   - Try to invite "admin" user to the team

6. Test with admin user:
   - Login as admin (admin/Kiki1999@)
   - GET /api/teams/my-invitations (should show invitation from testuser)
   - POST /api/teams/invitations/{invitation_id}/accept (accept the invitation)

This will test the core team creation, invitation, and acceptance flow."

    message: "✅ MISSING BUTTONS FIXED: Comprehensive enhancement of tournament navigation completed. Added missing 'View Details' and 'View Bracket' buttons across all user scenarios: 1) Enhanced tournament cards with bracket viewing for ongoing/completed tournaments, 2) Added login prompt for unauthenticated users, 3) Improved admin panel with separate View Details, View Bracket, Start Tournament, Edit, and Cancel buttons, 4) Enhanced dashboard 'My Tournaments' section with quick actions including bracket viewing, 5) Fixed duplicate bracket sections in tournament details, 6) Added responsive design for mobile views. All navigation scenarios now properly covered for different user states and tournament statuses."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "I've completed comprehensive testing of the Tournament Bracket System backend. All bracket-related endpoints are working correctly with proper authentication and validation. The bracket generation logic correctly handles different participant counts, including non-power-of-2 counts with byes. The match winner logic properly advances winners to the next round and updates tournament status when completed. All tests passed successfully."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "I've completed additional testing of the Tournament Bracket System. The bracket generation endpoint correctly validates that at least 2 participants are required to generate a bracket. The endpoint returns a 400 error with appropriate message when attempting to generate a bracket for a tournament with fewer than 2 participants. This is the expected behavior to ensure fair tournament brackets."

All specified credentials (testuser/test123, admin/Kiki1999@, God/Kiki1999@) work correctly with the /api/login endpoint. Each login returns a valid JWT token that can be used to access protected endpoints. The authentication system correctly validates credentials and returns appropriate user information.

    message: "I've completed comprehensive testing of the Wallet System and Admin Financial Management endpoints. All endpoints are working correctly with proper authentication, data validation, and business logic. The wallet system correctly handles balance retrieval, stats calculation, transaction listing, and settings updates. The admin financial management system correctly handles financial overview, wallet listing, transaction listing, and manual adjustments. The integration between the affiliate system and wallet is working correctly, with wallet balances and transactions properly reflecting affiliate earnings. All tests passed successfully."
  - agent: "main"
    message: "✅ MANUAL ADJUSTMENT MODAL FIXED: Successfully resolved the persistent modal visibility issue in the Admin Financial Overview. The problem was identified as a CSS background color conflict where the modal overlay was using 'rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.8)' (red background) instead of the standard 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8)' (dark background). This was corrected by the frontend testing agent, and the modal now displays properly with correct visibility and functionality. Backend API for manual adjustments was already working correctly."

    message: "I've completed testing of the Admin Users endpoint (GET /api/admin/users). The endpoint is working correctly and returns a list of all users in the system with complete user details. The endpoint properly requires admin authentication and returns the expected user information. Found 74 users in the system with proper user information including username, email, country, full name, and admin role. This endpoint will be useful for the manual adjustment modal UX improvement as it provides all the necessary user information for selection."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "I've fixed and tested the manual adjustment endpoint with username functionality. The issue was in the log_admin_action function, which was using target_tournament_id parameter for user IDs, causing ObjectId serialization errors. I updated the function to accept a target_user_id parameter and added proper ObjectId serialization handling. I successfully tested both scenarios: 1) Using username ('testuser') and 2) Using user ID ('0ac28113-7e6c-4939-a4ff-888bd399339b'). Both tests passed successfully, with the endpoint correctly identifying users by either username or user ID and properly updating their wallet balance."

    message: "I've tested the 'God' admin user issue. Both 'God' and 'admin' users can successfully log in and access the /api/admin/users endpoint. The 'God' user has admin_role of 'god' and the 'admin' user has admin_role of 'admin'. The admin role hierarchy in the system is correctly implemented with God > super_admin > admin > user. This confirms that the 'God' admin user is working correctly and has the highest level of privileges in the system."

    message: "❌ TEAM SYSTEM UI TESTING FAILED: I've attempted to test the Team System UI components but encountered critical compilation errors. The main issues are: 1) Duplicate declaration of fetchTeams function (lines 1900 and 2067), 2) Missing renderTeams function implementation, 3) Missing team-related CSS styles in App.css. The application cannot compile and run due to these issues. The Team System UI components (renderTeams function, Team Creation Modal, Team Invitation Modal, and CSS styles) need to be properly implemented before they can be tested."
  - agent: "testing"

The GET /api/teams/{team_id} endpoint returns detailed team information including members. The POST /api/teams/{team_id}/invite endpoint correctly validates that a user can only be invited if they're not already in a team. The GET /api/teams/my-invitations endpoint works correctly for users with pending invitations. All tests passed successfully with expected behavior."

The renderTeams function is properly defined and working. The Team Creation Modal and Team Invitation Modal are also working correctly. The team-related CSS styles are properly applied.
